# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with React, showcasing my professional journey, skills, and achievements. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes various sections such as About, Experience, Tools, Projects, Contact, Certifications, Achievements, and a Performance Review popup for 2024.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Interactive Sections**: Includes animated sections for About, Experience, Tools, Projects, Contact, Certifications, and Achievements using Framer Motion.
- **Performance Review Popup**: A modal popup in the Achievements section displays a slider with 15 Performance Review slides for 2024, complete with navigation, pagination, autoplay, and a downloadable PDF.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images in the Performance Review slider are lazy-loaded for better performance.
- **Accessibility**: The Performance Review modal supports closing via the `Esc` key and clicking outside the modal.
- **Downloadable Content**: A link to download the Performance Review as a PDF is included in the modal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.  

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
